 # Motivations


##### How does this project relate to the material covered in CSCB58?

We learned in lecture how FSMs are used to model the behaviour of systems, and in lab we practiced designing FSMs to control a datapath. Our project directly overlaps with this concept; we implement a FSM to control our datapath, which calculates the next game state. Also, the game features make good use of the code written in previous labs (such as hex decoders, rate dividers, counters, shift registers, etc), and we have plans to modify them to fit our game requirements. 

##### Why is this project interesting/cool (for CSCB58 students, and for non CSCB58 students?)

If we can make the game be played against a computer opponent (which makes the strongest move possible in any game state), this would showcase some pretty neat AI stuff. We hope that our project inspires future CSCB58 students to move projects up the difficulty scale by introducing some AI. We also think that this project can easily be modified to be another game (such as tic-tac-toe), and so our code can act as a foundation for future projects. 

Aside from that, Subtract Square is a strategy game, which means that with some smart thinking, a player can beat their opponent.  

##### Why did you personally choose this project?

Implementing Subtract Square was one of Jayaâ€™s CSC148 assignments, and we thought it would be neat to add more features to this game.
