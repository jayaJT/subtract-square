# Proposal

Our team will be pair programming during the lab sessions. 

#### What do you plan to have completed by the end of the first lab session?

Team A: Debug and test player vs. player module. 

Team B: Debug and test timer (to be displayed on HEX[7:6])and pseudo-random number generator (to be displayed on HEX[2:0]). Test that binary coded decimal converter works. Also debug code that displays game state on HEX[2:0] and subtrahend on HEX[5:4]. 

#### What do you plan to have completed by the end of the second lab session?

Team A: Continue to debug and complete player vs player module. This module ties together game features. 

Team B: Test LFSR and if prepared before the week 2 lab, debug and test code using the LCD screen: we hope to use this screen to display the timer. Also assist Team A in debugging the player vs player module. 

#### What do you plan to have completed by the end of the third lab session?

Teams A & B: We aim to have a finished product by the end of the session. We plan to use the first two hours debugging and testing the smaller modules before tying them together, and hopefully leaving the last hour for working on any additional features to our game.   

#### What is your backup plan if things don’t work out as planned?

We are going to build our “back-up” plan first, which is the player vs player game. Once this is completed, we will build on this code to implement the player vs computer opponent feature. Also, we’ve brainstormed many features, which include “easy” ones. 

(updated: Jul 8): We are using our backup game as our project. Please see updated project description.
